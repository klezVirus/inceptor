# SysWhispers2

SysWhispers helps with evasion by generating header/ASM files implants can use to make direct system calls.

All core syscalls are supported and example generated files available in the `example-output/` folder.

## Difference Between SysWhispers 1 and 2

The usage is almost identical to [SysWhispers1](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers) but you don't have to specify which versions of Windows to support. Most of the changes are under the hood. It no longer relies on [@j00ru](https://twitter.com/j00ru)'s [syscall tables](https://github.com/j00ru/windows-syscalls), and instead uses the "[sorting by system call address](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/12/bypassing-user-mode-hooks-and-direct-invocation-of-system-calls-for-red-teams/)" technique popularized by [@modexpblog](https://twitter.com/modexpblog). This significantly reduces the size of the syscall stubs.

The specific implementation in SysWhispers2 is a variation of @modexpblog's code. One difference is that the function name hashes are randomized on each generation. [@ElephantSe4l](https://twitter.com/ElephantSe4l), who had [published](https://www.crummie5.club/freshycalls/) this technique earlier, has another [implementation](https://github.com/crummie5/FreshyCalls) based in C++17 which is also worth checking out.

The original SysWhispers repository is still up but may be deprecated in the future.

## Introduction

Various security products place hooks in user-mode API functions which allow them to redirect execution flow to their engines and detect for suspicious behaviour. The functions in `ntdll.dll` that make the syscalls consist of just a few assembly instructions, so re-implementing them in your own implant can bypass the triggering of those security product hooks. This technique was popularized by [@Cn33liz](https://twitter.com/Cneelis) and his [blog post](https://outflank.nl/blog/2019/06/19/red-team-tactics-combining-direct-system-calls-and-srdi-to-bypass-av-edr/) has more technical details worth reading.

SysWhispers provides red teamers the ability to generate header/ASM pairs for any system call in the core kernel image (`ntoskrnl.exe`). The headers will also include the necessary type definitions.

## Installation

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers2.git
> cd SysWhispers2
> py .\syswhispers.py --help
```

## Usage and Examples

### Command Lines

```powershell
# Export all functions with compatibility for all supported Windows versions (see example-output/).
py .\syswhispers.py --preset all -o syscalls_all

# Export just the common functions (see below for list).
py .\syswhispers.py --preset common -o syscalls_common

# Export NtProtectVirtualMemory and NtWriteVirtualMemory with compatibility for all versions.
py .\syswhispers.py --functions NtProtectVirtualMemory,NtWriteVirtualMemory -o syscalls_mem
```

### Script Output

```
PS C:\Projects\SysWhispers2> py .\syswhispers.py --preset common --out-file syscalls_common

### Before-and-After Example of Classic `CreateRemoteThread` DLL Injection

```
py .\syswhispers.py -f NtAllocateVirtualMemory,NtWriteVirtualMemory,NtCreateThreadEx -o syscalls
```

```c
#include <Windows.h>

void InjectDll(const HANDLE hProcess, const char* dllPath)
{
    LPVOID lpBaseAddress = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, strlen(dllPath), MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE);
    LPVOID lpStartAddress = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(L"kernel32.dll"), "LoadLibraryA");
	
    WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, lpBaseAddress, dllPath, strlen(dllPath), nullptr);
    CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, nullptr, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)lpStartAddress, lpBaseAddress, 0, nullptr);
}
```

```c
#include <Windows.h>
#include "syscalls.h" // Import the generated header.

void InjectDll(const HANDLE hProcess, const char* dllPath)
{
    HANDLE hThread = NULL;
    LPVOID lpAllocationStart = nullptr;
    SIZE_T szAllocationSize = strlen(dllPath);
    LPVOID lpStartAddress = GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle(L"kernel32.dll"), "LoadLibraryA");
	
    NtAllocateVirtualMemory(hProcess, &lpAllocationStart, 0, (PULONG)&szAllocationSize, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE);
    NtWriteVirtualMemory(hProcess, lpAllocationStart, (PVOID)dllPath, strlen(dllPath), nullptr);
    NtCreateThreadEx(&hThread, GENERIC_EXECUTE, NULL, hProcess, lpStartAddress, lpAllocationStart, FALSE, 0, 0, 0, nullptr);
}
```

## Common Functions

Using the `--preset common` switch will create a header/ASM pair with the following functions:

## Importing into Visual Studio

1. Copy the generated H/C/ASM files into the project folder.
2. In Visual Studio, go to *Project* → *Build Customizations...* and enable MASM.
3. In the *Solution Explorer*, add the .h and .c/.asm files to the project as header and source files, respectively.
4. Go to the properties of the ASM file, and set the *Item Type* to *Microsoft Macro Assembler*.
5. Ensure that the project platform is set to x64. 32-bit projects are not supported at this time.

## Caveats and Limitations

- Only 64-bit Windows is supported at this time.
- System calls from the graphical subsystem (`win32k.sys`) are not supported.
- Tested on Visual Studio 2019 (v142) with Windows 10 SDK.

## Troubleshooting

- Type redefinitions errors: a project may not compile if typedefs in `syscalls.h` have already been defined.
  - Ensure that only required functions are included (i.e. `--preset all` is rarely necessary).
  - If a typedef is already defined in another used header, then it could be removed from `syscalls.h`.
